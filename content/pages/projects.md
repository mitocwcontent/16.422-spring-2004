Term Project Assignment
-----------------------

The purpose of this final project is to allow you to synthesize the knowledge gained in this class with either current research projects or potential research interests. There are three general areas that you can pick from:

1.  Design and conduct an experiment in which you explore some measure of human performance through testing, analyze the results, and discuss the broader implications.  
    
2.  Develop a case study relevant to the integration of complex sociotechnical systems (aviation, other forms or transportation, medical systems, etc.). This format should include a comprehensive historical view as well as an analysis of both technical and social issues, with some focus on implications for the future. System level case studies are especially recommended.  
    
3.  Design an actual display that uses automation for decision support. The displays do not have to be fully functional, but should include some level of functionality. While formal experimental testing is not required, a small group of users should be used to identify problems with the design to include functionality evaluation as well as recommendation for future improvements and systems integration.

The topic for each of these areas is entirely your choosing but you may ask the instructors for ideas in all three categories as well as for suggestions on how to modify existing research to fit within the project parameters. You will be required to submit a literature review for this project as well as provide a brief 10 minute presentation by Lecture 13 of your progress and intentions.
